# Bachlor Thesis: Sports Data Analysis in the NFL
Code I have written for my Bachlor Thesis

Bachlor Arbeit V2.ipynb contains code for data loading, preprocessing, visualisation and evaluation. 
The R scripts contains the code for training and evalutuating the different model types. 

It is kinda mixed up a little bit, since the data is first loaded via Python, then written as csv files then loaded into R, 
used for training the models then again the results written as csv files and then again loaded into the Jupyter Notebook for 
analysation and visualization. 

In retrospective this was not the optimal way and I should have choosen only one language. I also should have written the code more modular.
